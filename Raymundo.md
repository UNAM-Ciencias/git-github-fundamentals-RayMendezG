### Solved Doubts
Thanks to this basic guide I was able to solve several questions I still had about the use of GitHub.
For example, I wasn't sure about what the differences were between doing a *fork* and *clonning* a repository.
Another think I learned was what happened when someone wants to merge a branch to another that isn't the main branch.

### What's next
I'm looking forward to work with my teammate and using all of this new stuffs I learned, in particular I'm excited about the use of branches.
